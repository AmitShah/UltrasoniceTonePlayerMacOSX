you have to manually install the following dependencies :
libfec
libliquid-dsp
libjasson
libquiet
libsndfile -- system default

after installation include static lib items of each of the above in the bundle via Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries

Ensure the header search path and the library search paths include the installation path for the header and static/dynamic libs (dylibs work fine in xcode but not so in unity when we bundle)
